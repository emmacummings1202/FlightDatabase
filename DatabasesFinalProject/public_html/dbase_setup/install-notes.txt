Our stored procedures are sql files that should also be inside our public_html folder.
These stores procedures are used by our .php files (much like the format used in homework 4).

It should be noted that our setup.sql and setup-small.sql are not identical, given the extended time
frame of our project and how Rose and I were working on different time lines, the small-setup 
includes a lot more individual tables that were cut out in setup.sql. The data in the -small text
files are also arranged slightly differently as at the time they were made, the cleaned data was 
not available yet. The -small text files were manually made and so were never got around to being 
the same format at the larger text files. Given these facts, the stored procedures used in the php 
files could not also be used for the setup-small tables. 

One note is that upon running setup.sql it should take a long amount of time because our data set 
is very large. Both setup.sql and setup-small.sql should run smoothly without errors.
