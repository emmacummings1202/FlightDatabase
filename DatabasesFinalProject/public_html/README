We recieved an extension for most parts of this project so we didn't have feedback for Phase E, but 
while making interactive queries we had to change the wording of a few in order for the user to be 
able to input a value that could easily change the query results. There were some queries that we 
had to change around because through more testing we realized that they weren't properly working, 
but they should be fully functioning now.
